# TÉCNICAS AVANZADAS DE HIBRIDACIÓN PARA METAHEURÍSTICAS

### Summary

In this project we will study the behavior of hybrid models which are composed of different combinations of evolutionary algorithms, mainly, basic genetic algorithms. For this study we will use different real-coding problems obtained from CEC’14 (Test Function Suite Optimization). We will analyze the behavior of these algorithms for some of the functions of different characteristics: unimodal and multimodal functions, hybrid function, and other type of functions as result of a composition of previous functions working together.


The main objective can be summarized as a comparative analysis of different kind of hybridization evolutive models. Firstly, we are going to implement different kinds of Genetic Algorithms, changing the operators and parameters of the functions in two different versions: generational and steady-state genetic versions.

In a second place, we are going to generate a classic Island Model that incorporates different combinations of the algorithms that have been evaluated individually. For last, we are going to implement other Hybrid Models, which are characterized for being innovative and adaptative models. Then, we will repeat the previous procedure, and we’ll obtaing the model’s results for the three versions that we have mentioned earlier. After doing an individual analysis of these hybrid models, we’ll compare the results of every hybrid implementation with the aim of understanding the behavior of genetic algorithms in hybrid models.


 ### Main objective
 The objetive here are mainly two things. In a first place, knowing about the advantages and disadvantages of each model, and in a second place, deciding which of the models, we think is the best, explaining why and when we’d use each model.
